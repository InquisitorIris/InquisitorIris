## Hi there! <img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/85001-pinkpandawaveq/download" width="24"/>

I'm InquisitorIris aka Siri A R, an aspiring **Software Development Engineer** starting over from scratch â€” rebuilding my coding foundation and documenting everything along the way. Iâ€™ve always had a thing for problem-solving and tech, but now Iâ€™m making it official: writing code every day and learning in public.

- Iâ€™m currently working at **Cisco**
- Iâ€™m currently learning to code from the ground up and documenting my journey
- Reach me at: inquistoriris@outlook.com
- Pronouns: <span style="color:#FF66CC;">she/her/hers</span>
- Fun fact: I grew up on Phineas & Ferb, so I take my curiosity as seriously as Doofenshmirtz takes monologues.

This GitHub is my digital notebook â€” filled with experiments, small wins, and steady progressðŸŒ±
